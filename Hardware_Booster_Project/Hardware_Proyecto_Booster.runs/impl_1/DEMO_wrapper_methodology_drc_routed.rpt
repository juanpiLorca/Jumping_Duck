TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and sys_clk_pin are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks sys_clk_pin]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and sys_clk_pin are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks sys_clk_pin]

There is a large setup violation of -1.791 ns between DEMO_i/AXI_SPWM_driver_0/U0/AXI_SPWM_driver_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/SPWM_inst/local_oscillator_inst/sine_wave_memory_inst/geqOp_carry_i_3_psbram_1/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and DEMO_i/ila_0/U0/ila_core_inst/shifted_data_in_reg[7][1]_srl8_srlopt/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
